Hey there! Welcome to Apache Answer, a Q&A platform software. We've got a bunch of curious and helpful users who are always willing to give a hand.

If you're having trouble finding an answer to your question, check out our [community](#answer-meta), [documentations](/docs), [issues](/community/issues), or [mailing list](#mailing-list). If you find a question that you can answer, please do! Even if your answer isn't perfect, our volunteers will be happy to help you fill in the gaps.

If you're still having trouble after checking our documentation and other resources, feel free to [contact us](#others). Since our users and contributors come from all over the world, so we recommend using English as primary communication language for the best possible assistance.

## Apache Answer Meta

Apache Answer Meta is also a great way to keep track of questions and answers, and it helps to ensure that the content is always up-to-date.
