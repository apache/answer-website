# Translation

Our project is connected to [crowdin](https://crowdin.com/) for translation; we recommend contributing translations through crowdin.

Translate project list:

- [crowdin-apache-answer](https://crowdin.com/project/answer)
- [crowdin-apache-answer-website](https://crowdin.com/project/answer-website)

## Why recommend crowdin

1. Through crowdin, translators only need to focus on the translation work itself, and crowdin will provide very convenient prompts;
2. No additional operations are required, such as git commands. Our apache-answer project language file uses yaml. Some contributors are likely to format the indentation or operate by mistake, causing some formatting errors;
