# Pull Request

We appreciate you taking the time to contribute! Before submitting a pull request, we ask that you please create an issue that explains the bug or feature request and let us know that you plan on creating a pull request for it. If an issue already exists, please comment on that issue letting us know you would like to submit a pull request for it. This helps us to keep track of the pull request and make sure there isn't duplicated effort.

## Semantic commit messages

Following the format below when committing message can make you a better programmer.

```txt
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

- `type`

  - `feat`: A new feature.
  - `fix`: A bug fix.
  - `docs`: Documentation only changes.
  - `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc).
  - `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
  - `perf`: A code change that improves performance.
  - `test`: Adding missing tests.
  - `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation.

- `scope`

  - The scope can be anything specifying place of the commit change.

- `subject`
  - The subject contains a succinct description of the change.
  - Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
  - Do not capitalize first letter.
  - Do not place a period `.` at the end.
  - Entire length of the commit message must not go over 50 characters.
  - Describe what the commit does, not what issue it relates to or fixes.
  - Be brief, yet descriptive - we should have a good understanding of what the commit does by reading the subject.

## Contributor license agreement (CLA)

Apache CLA short for Apache Contributor License Agreement, the purpose of this agreement is to clearly define the terms under which intellectual property has been contributed to the ASF and thereby allow us to defend the project should there be a legal dispute regarding the software at some future time. A signed ICLA is required to be on file before an individual is given commit rights to any ASF project.

For larger contributions, contributed by a single original author, we might ask you to submit an [Individual Contributor License Agreement (ICLA)](https://www.apache.org/licenses/contributor-agreements.html) form. The copyright on your code will still belong to you, but the ICLA helps protect the users of Apache Answer. All project Committers have also signed this form.

If you have already signed an Apache ICLA, no need to send an email. As you have already submitted an ICLA under your public name, no need to resubmit it. If you have never signed an ICLA, please indicate this in your email, and PMC can apply for this account directly.
