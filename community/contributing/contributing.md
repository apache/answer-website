## Code of conduct

Apache Answer has adopted a Code of Conduct that we expect project participants to adhere to. Please read the [full text](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct.html) so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.

## Get involved

There are many ways to contribute to Answer, and many of them do not involve writing any code. Here's a few ideas to get started:

- Simply start using Answer. Go through the [Getting Started](/docs/installation) guide. Does everything work as expected? If not, we're always looking for improvements. Let us know by [opening an issue](/community/issues).
- Look through the [open issues](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer/issues). Provide workarounds, ask for clarification, or suggest labels. Help [triage issues](#triaging-issues-and-pull-requests).
- If you find an issue you would like to fix, [open a pull request](/community/pull-request). Issues tagged as [Good first issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer/labels/good%20first%20issue) are a good place to get started.
- Read through the [Answer docs](/docs). If you find anything that is confusing or can be improved, you can click "Edit this page" at the bottom of most docs, which takes you to the GitHub interface to make and propose changes.
- Take a look at the [features requested](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer/labels/enhancement) by others in the community and consider opening a pull request if you see something you want to work on.

Contributions are very welcome. If you think you need help planning your contribution, please ping us on Twitter at [@answerdev](https://twitter.com/answerdev) and let us know you are looking for a bit of help.

### Join Answer Meta

We have the `#contributing` and `#development` tags on [Answer Meta](https://meta.answer.dev) to discuss all things about Answer development. You can also be of great help by helping other users in the `#support` tag.

### Triaging issues and pull requests

One great way you can contribute to the project without writing any code is to help triage issues and pull requests as they come in.

- Ask for more information if you believe the issue does not provide all the details required to solve it.
- Suggest [labels](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer/labels) that can help categorize issues.
- Flag issues that are stale or that should be closed.
- Ask for test plans and review code.

## Development process

Answer uses [GitHub](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer) as its source of truth. The core team will be working directly there. All changes will be public from the beginning.

All pull requests will be checked by the continuous integration system, GitHub actions. There are unit tests, and much more.

### Branch organization

Answer has one primary branch `main` and we use feature branches with deploy previews to deliver new features with pull requests.
