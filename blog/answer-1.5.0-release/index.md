## üéâ New Features

### Full-Width Layout with Sticky Left Menu

This update introduces a brand-new full-width layout. The left menu now supports sticky positioning, and the admin panel menu maintains consistency with the main site while adding icons to distinguish between different navigation levels, providing users with a smoother browsing experience.
